Welcome! I am a late-stage PhD student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA, USA. My work focuses on semantic and computational models for non-verbal communication, such as gesture and grunts, using naturalistic multimodal data. I also work full-time managing Machine Learning research and Annotation teams at a large SaaS company.
