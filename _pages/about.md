Welcome! I am a late-stage PhD student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University, advised by Professor James Pustejovsky. My research focuses on formal semantic and computational models for non-verbal communication, such as gesture and grunts, using naturalistic multimodal data. 

I received my MA in Computational Linguistics from Brandeis and BA in Linguistics & Italian from Boston College. I also work full-time as a Director of Research at a large SaaS company, managing ML research and annotation teams focused on speech and conversational data.
